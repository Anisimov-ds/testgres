### What's this?

This is a set of git hooks to be executed on special events, e.g. before you commit your changes. To install them, just execute the `install.sh` script, and you're good to go!

### What do they do?

Currently there's only one hook (`pre-commit`) which formats changed python files with `yapf`.
