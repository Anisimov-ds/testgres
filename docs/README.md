# Building the documentation

Make sure you have `Sphinx` and `sphinxcontrib-napoleon` packages installed:

```
pip install Sphinx sphinxcontrib-napoleon
```

Then just run

```
make html
```

Documentation will be built in `build/html` directory. Other output formats are also available; run `make` without arguments to see the options.
